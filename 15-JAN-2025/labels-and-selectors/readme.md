# Labels and Selectors 
- Labels are the mechanism you use to organise kubernetes objects.
- A label is a key value pair without any predefined meaning that can be attached to the objects.
- ```{
kubectl get pods 
}```
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
