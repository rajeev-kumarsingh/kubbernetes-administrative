# Kubernetes vs Other Orchestration Tools

## üß† What is Kubernetes?
**Kubernetes** (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google and maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## üîß What are Container Orchestration Tools?
Container orchestration tools help manage multiple containers, especially in large-scale, distributed environments. They handle:
- **Scheduling and deployment**
- **Scaling up/down**
- **Load balancing**
- **Health monitoring and self-healing**
- **Networking and storage orchestration**

## ‚úÖ When to Use Kubernetes
- For **large-scale** microservices architecture
- Need **robust automation** (self-healing, autoscaling, rolling updates)
- Integration with **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Cloud-native** architecture (AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.)
- Multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud setups

## üö´ Kubernetes May Be Overkill If:
- You're working on **small teams or single-host setups**
- You just need basic container management ‚Äî consider **Docker Compose** or **Nomad**
